Logs_reader_app
==================
To run the program you need to run the main method. 
Files for reading must be placed in the files folder 
in the resources.

Files must be in .txt format. Entries in files must be
 in the format - "19: 47: 56.022 / [username] / test message"

The application reads these files and writes the result 
of the execution to the file that appears in the project root.
